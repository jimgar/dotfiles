## Neovim

I started to try out Neovim in April 2024 after spending a few months using the Vim extension for VS Code. I love the classic hacker feel of Vim/Neovim, which reminds me of being a kid.

I am very much stumbling about and getting a feel for the plugin ecosystem at the moment, while dipping in and out of the help pages. This means my config is big and currently only consists of an `options.lua` and `plugins.lua`. In time I hope this will become modularised, leaner, and I can maintain a mini overview here.
